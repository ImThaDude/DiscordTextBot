Discord Text Bot

The purpose of this bot is to unity users that do not use discord and users that use discord for my channel.

Problems:
Needs a Google Voice account. Likewise getting to the config its confusing. Its under PATH environment variable.
Dependencies are weird so there is a need to change websocket, ioasync and discord.py to work correctly.
Needs to be more pythonean.

Features:
Reminders over discord/text
Events over discord/text
Commands from text
Replying over test to discord
Subscribing and unsubscribing
-Seding messages to text
Sending images and memes
